# React Native Asynchronous Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving asynchronous data fetching using the `fetch` API. The problem occurs when a component attempts to render before the asynchronous operation completes, resulting in an unexpected blank screen or error.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data from an API.  However, it incorrectly handles the asynchronous nature of the `fetch` API. This leads to `this.state.data` being `null` during the initial render, causing a blank screen until the data is fetched.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix this issue using asynchronous rendering techniques, specifically the `useEffect` hook with the `[]` dependency array to ensure the fetch operation only runs once after the component mounts.  It also handles potential errors during the fetch process.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-native-async-fetch-bug`
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the application on your emulator or device.  You might need to have an Android emulator or iOS simulator setup.
